# install-octopus-cli-action

This is a GitHub Action to install the [Octopus CLI](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/octopus-cli) on runners and self-hosted environments. Once installed, the Octopus CLI may be used to issue commands to [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/). Subsequent actions may use the Octopus CLI, which is cached and available via `PATH`.

## What is the Octopus CLI?

The Octopus CLI is a command line tool that builds on top of the [Octopus REST API](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api). It enables you to package applications for deployment and manage your environments, deployments, channels, projects, and workers in Octopus Deploy.

## Features

- Download, install, and cache Octopus CLI to be used in workflows
- Supports SemVer-based version numbers with wildcards (i.e. `8.*`) but not ranges

## Examples

To install the latest version (i.e. `*` or `latest`) of the Octopus CLI:

```yml
- name: Install Octopus CLI üêô
  uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1
  with:
    version: '*'
```

To install a specific version of the Octopus CLI:

```yml
- name: Install Octopus CLI üêô
  uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1
  with:
    version: 9.0.0
```

Here's an example of invoking the `list-deployments` command after installing the Octopus CLI:

```yml
- name: Install Octopus CLI üêô
  uses: OctopusDeploy/install-octopus-cli-action@v1
  with:
    version: 9.0.0
- name: list-octopusdeploy-deployments
  run: >
    octo list-deployments --server=${{ env.serverURL }}
      --apiKey=${{ secrets.apiKey }}
```
